# YouTubeD
YouTubeD is a program built in Python that allows you to download videos from YouTube. 
It is a useful tool for people who want to save videos for offline viewing, or for those who want to create a collection of their favorite videos.

To use the YouTubeD program, you will need to have two libraries installed on your computer: youtube_dl and tkinter.
To install these libraries, you can use the pip package manager that comes with Python. 
Open a command prompt or terminal window and run the following commands:

pip install youtube_dl

pip install tkinter

If you are using Python 3, you may need to use "pip3" instead of "pip" to install these libraries. 
Once the libraries are installed, you can run the YouTubeD program and start downloading videos from YouTube.
